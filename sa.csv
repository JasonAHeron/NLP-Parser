"arg4","0","8","Action","S2 believes "

"arg4","1","10","Evaluation","S2 is making a generalization on the entire party's based off one person."
"arg4","1","11","Action","S2 thinks this unfair "

"arg5","1","0","Action","S1 argues "

"arg5","1","3","Evaluation","Marriage's legal definition closely mirrors that definition."

"arg5","1","18","Evaluation","S1 says appropriateness is irrelevant."
"arg5","1","19","Evaluation","Cultural definitions have formed the root of all other definitions."
"arg5","1","20","Evaluation","The cultural definition of marriage has always been one male and female in monogamy."

"arg5","2","3","Action","He argues "
"arg5","2","4","Evaluation","that this definition automatically excludes homosexuals "

"arg5","3","7","Action","This person does not believe "

"arg5","3","10","Action","S2 argues against the idea "

"arg5","3","14","Evaluation","They believe what defines marriage is love between two people who desire a commitment between themselves."
"arg5","3","15","Action","They argue "

"arg5","4","0","Action","S1 states "
"arg5","4","1","Orientation","that the legal definition of marriage is a contract between a man and a woman, who are not related, with no regard to love, or the intention of reproduction."
"arg5","4","2","Action","S1 maintains, from the basis of observation, "
"arg5","4","3","Evaluation","that the cultural definition of marriage is a formalization of a mating pair, love and the intension to reproduce being implied."
"arg5","4","4","Action","Saying that homosexual couples are not a part of either definition, "
"arg5","4","5","Evaluation","and that being included in the current definition is a catch-22, as homosexuality is not in sync with evolution."
"arg5","4","6","Action","S1 further states that the only connection between, mating couples and marriage, are cultural."
"arg5","4","7","Action","S2 defines marriage as a commitment between two people who love one another."
"arg5","4","8","Action","Using a hypothetical marriage between a 65 year old woman and a 68 year old man as an example, argues "
