"arg1","0","Action","Writer 16 asked writer 17 why they think government should be involved in marriage."
"arg1","0","Action","Writer 17 replied with the statement that the only reason people are complaining about the government in marriage now is because it is becoming legal for homosexuals to be married."
"arg1","0","Evaluation","Writer 16 said that there are some hyprocrites out there "
"arg1","0","Evaluation","but that doesn't mean that thier ideas are bad ones "
"arg1","0","Evaluation","and that it can be detrimental to single and unmarried couples for the government to be involved in marriage."
"arg1","0","Action","Then writer 17 states that marriage incorporates many benefits without having to deal with the lawyers "
"arg1","0","Evaluation","and so the government should stay in it. "
"arg1","1","Orientation","Writer 16 and 17 are discussing whether the goverment should get involved in mariage."
"arg1","1","Action","Write 17 brings up that people are avoiding getting married simply due to the fact that homosexuals are also getting married "
"arg1","1","Evaluation","and this ruins the mariage institution for some."
"arg1","1","Action","Writer 17 also says that the government tends to get involed in many of these types of things "
"arg1","1","Evaluation","so it is not uncommon "
"arg1","1","Evaluation","while write 16 believes that it is unesessary for the government to get involed. "
"arg1","2","Action","Te first person argued that mostly people benefit from having the government be involved in marriage."
"arg1","2","Action","The second person disagreed "
"arg1","2","Action","and said it is unnecessary "
"arg1","2","Evaluation","and it should be more on an individual bases."
"arg1","2","Evaluation","a lot of single people don't benefit from it "
"arg1","2","Evaluation","but they have to pay for it."
"arg1","2","Action","the first person stated that to take each case as an individual case would cost more "
"arg1","2","Evaluation","and would only benefit lawyers but not society as a whole. "
"arg1","3","Action","Writer 16 argued that the government should stay out of marriage "
"arg1","3","Evaluation","because the governments role in marriages negatively affects single people, among other reasons."
"arg1","3","Action","Writer 17 claimed that the government’s involvement in marriage was good, "
"arg1","3","Orientation","but that many people are now jumping the band wagon to claim otherwise."
"arg1","3","Orientation","One of these reasons is that Christians do not want homosexuals getting married "
"arg1","3","Evaluation","and therefore do not want the government supporting these marriages. "
"arg1","4","Action","writer 16 argued that the government should have no involvement in marriage "
"arg1","4","Evaluation","simply because there is no need and it is unfair for single people."
"arg1","4","Action","writer 17 argues that the government being involved in marriage is not only a good thing, "
"arg1","4","Evaluation","but is necessary because marriage licenses encompass most of the legal aspects of marriage already "
"arg1","4","Evaluation","and that being married provides a whole new set of potential legal issues that single people do not face. "
"arg1","5","Action","Writer 16 is asking writer 17 why they believe that the government should play a role in government, "
"arg1","5","Evaluation","as they feel it is not any of the government's business."
"arg1","5","Action","Writer 17 explains that governement has always been involved, "
"arg1","5","Evaluation","and a few "pesky gay people" shouldn't change that."
"arg1","5","Evaluation","Writer 17 thinks there should be more government involvement in marriage than there already is, involving single people."
"arg1","6","Action","Writer 16 was arguing that government need not be involved in the marriage of two people "
"arg1","6","Action","while writer 17 argued the opposite."
"arg1","6","Orientation","Writer 16 did not provide much basis as to why he believed this "
"arg1","6","Action","and simply stated that those that are married shouldn’t be afforded something that those that aren’t married can’t get."
"arg1","7","Evaluation","Writer 16 believed that the government should not be involved in the institution of marriage at all "
"arg1","7","Evaluation","while writer 17 believed that the government was necessary for handling and enforcing the benefits of marriage."
"arg1","7","Evaluation","Both writers used a ridiculous "forest and trees” argument repeatedly that didn’t help their cases at all. "
"arg1","8","Orientation","They were arguing about wether or not the government should be a part of and regulate marriages."
"arg1","8","Evaluation","Writer 16 was against goverment involvment "
"arg1","8","Evaluation","and writer 17 was all for it."
"arg1","8","Evaluation","Writer 16 biggest arguement was that goverment involvement in marriage was unessessary."
"arg1","8","Action","Writer 17 went into detain in how government involvement in marriage is needed.  "
"arg1","9","Evaluation","Writer 16 believes marriage should be regulated by the government, "
"arg1","9","Evaluation","because of the stability and reliability said regulations would bring."
"arg1","9","Evaluation","They believe there is no point to separating marriage for government, "
"arg1","9","Evaluation","since it would only bring problems like the one's they themselves faced."
"arg1","9","Action","Writer 17 disagrees and argues for separation. "
"arg2","0","Action","Writer 21 is arguing "
"arg2","0","Evaluation",",that a woman wants legal marriage to only be between a man and a woman."
"arg2","0","Evaluation",",Because this is what the woman wants "
"arg2","0","Evaluation",",and that this is her religious view point, "
"arg2","0","Action","21 claims she is obstructing 21’s religious freedom."
"arg2","0","Action","Then 21 goes onto say "
"arg2","0","Evaluation",",that her religious belief is that marriage should legally be between any genders, "
"arg2","0","Evaluation",",and that that should be the law."
"arg2","0","Action","Writer 22 explains "
"arg2","0","Evaluation",",why, by that logic no matter what the law becomes, some one’s religious freedom is being restricted."
"arg2","0","Action","22 asks 21 to explain how homosexual marriage , that does not get legal benefits infringes upon a religious freedom, "
"arg2","0","Action","but 21 continues only to repeat her main point."
"arg2","1","Orientation","Writer 21 begins the argument by asking why gay people shouldn't be allowed to marry, "
"arg2","1","Action","arguing that it does not impede on others "
"arg2","1","Evaluation",",as gay marriage prohibition does."
"arg2","1","Action","Writer 22 instantly turns this into a religious argument "
"arg2","1","Orientation","even though there was no mention by 21 about religious freedom."
"arg2","1","Action","They argue "
"arg2","1","Evaluation",",that banning gay marriage has nothing to do with impeding upon religious rights, "
"arg2","1","Orientation","as the ban is created by an institution that is seperate from religion."
"arg2","1","Action","Writer 21 responds by saying "
"arg2","1","Evaluation",",that if their religion is that any two people should be able to marry, it is being impeded upon."
"arg2","1","Action","Writer 22 takes this point and creates a slippery slope fallacy that takes writer 21's words out of context."
"arg2","2","Action","Writer 21 was arguing "
"arg2","2","Evaluation",",that marriage equality was necessary to his religious freedom "
"arg2","2","Evaluation",",and that a law banning gay marriage in the name of religious freedom was infringing upon his religious freedom."
"arg2","2","Action","Writer 22 stated "
"arg2","2","Evaluation",",that any law could be argued as unjust in the name of religious freedom, "
"arg2","2","Evaluation",",and it is therefore not an acceptable way to back a claim."
"arg2","2","Action","Writer 22 goes on to state "
"arg2","2","Evaluation",",that the lawmaker may have been making the law out of what she viewed as best for society, rather than from a place of religion.    "
"arg2","3","Action","Writer 21 is trying to assert "
"arg2","3","Evaluation",",that not legalizing gay marriage is an infringement on her religious rights."
"arg2","3","Action","She draws this conclusion "
"arg2","3","Evaluation",",because she thinks those who do not believe in gay marriage, for example, Christians, don't have the right to tell her she shouldn't be able to get married because she is gay."
"arg2","3","Action","Writer 22 doesn't believe this argument fits "
"arg2","3","Evaluation",",because people may not believe in gay marriage for a number of reasons, not just religion."
"arg2","4","Evaluation",",Writer 21 has my vote all the way."
"arg2","4","Orientation","They were arguing about gay marriage."
"arg2","4","Action","Writer 21 claims "
"arg2","4","Evaluation",",that writer 22 is trying to force their religion views into laws "
"arg2","4","Evaluation",",and that there is heterosexual priviledge."
"arg2","4","Evaluation",",If there were equal marriage for all, no one would be harmed or kept from marrying who they want to marry "
"arg2","4","Evaluation",",but the way that writer 22 is saying things should be, keeps the gay and lesbian community unable to wed."
"arg2","5","Action","writer 21 believes that "
"arg2","5","Evaluation",",opposing same sex marriage for religious reasons takes away the religious freedom of others "
"arg2","5","Action","while writer 22 believes "
"arg2","5","Evaluation",",that allowing same sex marriage takes away the religious freedom of those who oppose it; "
"arg2","5","Action","he also believes "
"arg2","5","Evaluation",",that claiming “freedom of religion” can be an excuse used for any ridiculous argument.  "
"arg2","6","Action","writer 21 argued "
"arg2","6","Evaluation",",that not accepting homosexual sex in law is infringing on her religious freedom "
"arg2","6","Evaluation",",and that it is harmful to her in that happened "
"arg2","6","Evaluation",",and the other party is just trying to keep their heterosexual privileges."
"arg2","6","Action","Writer 22 argued "
"arg2","6","Evaluation",",that it isnt a matter of religious freedom "
"arg2","6","Evaluation",",and she is looking at it in the wrong way."
"arg2","7","Action","Writer 21 is trying to argue "
"arg2","7","Evaluation",",that when “she” is trying to prevent homosexuals from getting married it is preventing their religious freedom."
"arg2","7","Action","Writer 22 points out "
"arg2","7","Evaluation",",that although it may go against writer 21’s religious belief it does not stop them from having religious freedom"
"arg2","8","Action","Writer 21 is arguing "
"arg2","8","Evaluation",",that her religious freedom is being infringed upon by gay marriage not being legal "
"arg2","8","Action","and writer 22 is arguing "
"arg2","8","Evaluation",",that it has nothing to do with her religious freedom "
"arg2","8","Evaluation",",and it would infringe just as much on the original writer’s religious freedom to have gay marriage be legal. "
"arg2","9","Orientation","They are talking about gay marriage and religous freedom."
"arg2","9","Action","Writer 1 believes "
"arg2","9","Evaluation",",that their religous freedom is being taken away because someone else believes that her heterosexual priviledges prevents gays from being able to get married."
"arg2","9","Action","Writer 22 is not agree "
"arg2","9","Evaluation",",and does not understand how gay marriage has to do with religous freedom. "
"arg3","0","Orientation","When writer 35 is asked how allowing gay marriage would hurt the other side (heterosexual relationships and marriage)."
"arg3","0","Action","They argue "
"arg3","0","Evaluation","that it does not hurt anyone, but merely offends them similar to the way that anti-gay people are offended by gays."
"arg3","0","Action","Writer 34 then mentions "
"arg3","0","Orientation","that there have been times in the past where the majority decided for the minority, "
"arg3","0","Action","using the main example of slavery."
"arg3","0","Evaluation","Writer 35 thinks this is outrageous "
"arg3","0","Evaluation","and sees no clear connection between the ban of gay marriage and other civil rights issues"
"arg3","1","Action","Writer 34 changed her argument a little to fit her needs better."
"arg3","1","Evaluation","She stuck to the idea that gay marriage should be legalized "
"arg3","1","Action","and gave examples of slavery, "
"arg3","1","Evaluation","which was a totally wrong thing, to support her argument."
"arg3","1","Action","Writer 35 dismissed this argument, saying "
"arg3","1","Evaluation","that it was no big deal for Wrter 34 to dislike Christian's views so strongly "
"arg3","1","Evaluation","because they dislike hers, too."
"arg3","2","Action","writer 35 argued "
"arg3","2","Evaluation","that the democratic process allows people to voice their opinions "
"arg3","2","Evaluation","and even those with opposing sides have the right to vote/influence policy even if it “harms” other individuals."
"arg3","2","Action","writer 34 believes "
"arg3","2","Evaluation","that lgbt people should be protected at all costs "
"arg3","2","Evaluation","and the enactment of public policy that harms people should be stopped. "
"arg3","3","Action","Writer 34 is trying to get the woman Ms. Mugrave to come out and say that she is anti-gay "
"arg3","3","Action","and then begins to state that they will protest weddings and other chruch events."
"arg3","3","Action","Writer 35 brings up the point "
"arg3","3","Evaluation","that laws are made by the majority for good or bad "
"arg3","3","Evaluation","and that nothing will be accomplished for the woman saying she is anti-gay"
"arg3","4","Action","Writer 34 argued that a woman is evil "
"arg3","4","Evaluation","because she does not believe in gay marriage."
"arg3","4","Evaluation","For the most part that and the idea that straight marriage only laws hurt gay people was the only point that 34 got across."
"arg3","4","Action","35 focused more on the idea of the law and facts "
"arg3","4","Evaluation","as opposed t personal opinions on the mater."
"arg3","5","Action","writer 34 is arguing that gay marriage should be allowed "
"arg3","5","Evaluation","and that it is against the constitution for anti-gay marriage laws to be passed, "
"arg3","5","Action","while writer 35 is arguing "
"arg3","5","Evaluation","that it isn’t any more illegal to have those laws than it is to have laws making gay marriage legal. "
"arg3","6","Action","Writer 34 is threatening to protest any heterosexual marriage and threaten church goers because they are "anti-gay"."
"arg3","6","Action","Writer 35 makes the argument "
"arg3","6","Evaluation","that because Writer 34 has the legal right to stand up for what they believe, so do all the "ant-gays"."
"arg3","7","Action","writer 34 was supporting gay marriage by suggesting "
"arg3","7","Evaluation","that it wasn't right for the majority to enforce their views on the helpless minority, "
"arg3","7","Action","while 35 explained "
"arg3","7","Evaluation","that in a democracy the majority wins, regardless of whether they're right."
"arg3","8","Action","writer 34 argued "
"arg3","8","Evaluation","that not accepting gay marriage in legislation is harmful to others."
"arg3","8","Action","writer 35 gave examples of how many laws are harmful to people "
"arg3","8","Evaluation","so why should this one be different.  "
"arg3","9","Action","Writer 34 still addresses the issue "
"arg3","9","Evaluation","that heterosexual marriage takes away from homosexual marriage "
"arg3","9","Evaluation","whereas homosexual marriage allows heterosexual marriages to stay."
"arg3","9","Action","Writer 35 argues for all points of views. "
"arg4","0","Action","Writer 47 claims that 48 is saying "
"arg4","0","Evaluation","that republicans are on a path similar to the holocaust."
"arg4","0","Evaluation","They are upset "
"arg4","0","Orientation","that Cameron's research is being used to represent the republican party "
"arg4","0","Action","when he explains multiple times "
"arg4","0","Orientation","that the republican party has distanced itself from his arguments."
"arg4","0","Action","Writer 48 claims that there are ties between Cameron's research and the republican party, "
"arg4","0","Evaluation","which is disgusting because the man allegedly reccomends the use of mass murders to "cleanse" a population."
"arg4","0","Action","Writer 47 says his research hasn't been used in years "
"arg4","0","Evaluation","and that it is ridiculous to assume that a gay holocaust is probable."
"arg4","0","Orientation","They both accuse each other of jumping around on topics throughout the debate."
"arg4","1","Action","Writer 47 argues "
"arg4","1","Evaluation","that you it doesn’t make sense to use one man’s words as a generalization of an entire political party when you aren’t even sure what his political stance is."
"arg4","1","Action","Writer 48 says it is obvious the republicans take this guy’s radical views seriously "
"arg4","1","Evaluation","and that they are just as crazy as he is."
"arg4","2","Evaluation","Writer 47 was upset with the other writer "
"arg4","2","Action","because he asserted "
"arg4","2","Evaluation","that Republican's wanted to put gays in a concentration camp."
"arg4","2","Evaluation","This other writer believed this because of a certain psychologist who believed this "
"arg4","2","Evaluation","and other Republicans agreed with and supported him."
"arg4","2","Action","Write 47 proclaimed this as proposterous "
"arg4","2","Evaluation","and said the other writer's information was faulty and extremely generalized."
"arg4","3","Action","writer 48 is claiming "
"arg4","3","Evaluation","that paul cameron is a popular source cited and quoted by the gop "
"arg4","3","Evaluation","and that his arguments are ridiculous."
"arg4","3","Action","writer 47 claims that the gop agrees "
"arg4","3","Evaluation","that he is not credible "
"arg4","3","Evaluation","and that there is no one who uses him as a resource. "
"arg4","4","Action","47 made points about how republicans hate the gays, "
"arg4","4","Action","by citing Paul Cameron as proof of that."
"arg4","4","Action","48 disagreed with this point and stated "
"arg4","4","Evaluation","that just because one republic puts out negative studies about gays does not mean all republicans feel the same way."
"arg4","5","Action","Writer 47 is criticizing writer 48 for bringing up Paul Cameron as an republican "
"arg4","5","Evaluation","and for just showing the radical side of the specific party."
"arg4","5","Action","Writer 48 is showing "
"arg4","5","Evaluation","that republicans are citing Paul Cameron constantly in their agruments against gay marriage."
"arg4","6","Orientation","These two are talkinag about people "
"arg4","6","Orientation","and if they support their claims or not."
"arg4","6","Evaluation","Writer 47 seems to support the gays "
"arg4","6","Evaluation","and think that those who do not are absurd "
"arg4","6","Evaluation","while writer 48 is more logical."
"arg4","7","Orientation","This appears to be the same argument as the last two continued."
"arg4","7","Action","They are arguing about gay marriage again, "
"arg4","7","Evaluation","but now the argument is getting more heated "
"arg4","7","Evaluation","and they are resorting to personal attacks. "
"arg4","8","Evaluation","Argument is off topic for most of the time."
"arg4","8","Evaluation","It seems as if the real argument lays upon gay marriage."
"arg4","8","Evaluation","These writers argue off topic about outside sources "
"arg4","8","Evaluation","and their reliability as well."
"arg4","9","Action","Writer 47 is suggesting "
"arg4","9","Evaluation","that the Republian party has very little to do with the radical anti-gays that writer 48 claims they quote and reference all the time."
"arg5","0","Action","Writer 52 believes "
"arg5","0","Evaluation","that marriage is between a man and a woman that is in love and interested in having a child."
"arg5","0","Action","Writer 53 thinks this is just writer 52's conception of marriage "
"arg5","0","Evaluation","and doesn't understand why this should be written into law."
"arg5","0","Action","Writer 53 believes "
"arg5","0","Evaluation","that the good parts of marriage, the ones that really matter, still apply in a homosexual relationship."
"arg5","0","Action","Writer 53 is considering "
"arg5","0","Evaluation","that love and care for one another is much more the essence of a marriage than reproduction and different sexual organs, "
"arg5","0","Action","using the example of a marriage between two older people that clearly wouldn't bear a child."
"arg5","0","Action","Writer 52 thinks "
"arg5","0","Evaluation","that some marriages are more respected than others, "
"arg5","0","Evaluation","and the ones that are most respected are ones that bear children out of love"
"arg5","1","Action","Writer 52 said "
"arg5","1","Evaluation","that gay marriage should not be legal "
"arg5","1","Evaluation","because it would not hold as much meaning as straight."
"arg5","1","Orientation","To 52 the meanings of marriage legally and culturally are that of age and consent, two different genders, and of reproduction and the creation of a family unit."
"arg5","1","Action","53 disagrees, stating "
"arg5","1","Evaluation","that not all marriages include procreation "
"arg5","1","Evaluation","and that 52 can not say for sure what the cultural views of America are."
"arg5","2","Action","Writer 52 believes "
"arg5","2","Evaluation","that a culteral agreement is between two people of the opposite sex "
"arg5","2","Evaluation","and this is because they can mate "
"arg5","2","Evaluation","while two people of the same sex are unable to do so."
"arg5","2","Orientation","They present themselves very strongly and are unsympathetic to the opinion of writer 53."
"arg5","2","Action","Writer 53 claims that they disagree "
"arg5","2","Evaluation","and it is not up to a single person to say what a culteral agreement is or is not. "
"arg5","3","Action","Writer 52 claims "
"arg5","3","Evaluation","that marriage should be between a man and a woman for the purpose of reproduction, "
"arg5","3","Action","while 53 claims "
"arg5","3","Evaluation","that it should be between two people who love each other."
"arg5","3","Evaluation","Both agree "
"arg5","3","Evaluation","that the other legal constraints are reasonable."
"arg5","3","Action","However, 53 believes "
"arg5","3","Evaluation","that it should be legal for homosexuals to marry, "
"arg5","3","Action","while 52 believes "
"arg5","3","Evaluation","that because  gay marriage is "wrong" it should remain illegal."
"arg5","4","Action","One writer argued for gay marriage "
"arg5","4","Action","and the other argued against it, saying "
"arg5","4","Evaluation","that the purpose of marriage was above all reproduction "
"arg5","4","Evaluation","and this should not be disturbed."
"arg5","4","Action","The other writer argued "
"arg5","4","Evaluation","that no one should be able to infringe on the rights of others just because of an opinion. "
"arg5","5","Action","52 argues "
"arg5","5","Evaluation","that culturally defined marriages are ones that have a chance for reproduction "
"arg5","5","Evaluation","and that that is why the legal definition for marriage excludes homosexuals."
"arg5","5","Action","53 says "
"arg5","5","Evaluation","that this cultural belief is out-dated "
"arg5","5","Evaluation","and what should define a marriage is that two people love each other."
"arg5","6","Orientation","Writer 52 and 53 are arguing whether gay marriage goes against the cultural and legal definition of marriage."
"arg5","6","Action","Writer 52 states "
"arg5","6","Evaluation","that marriage is defined as an act to promote reproduction "
"arg5","6","Evaluation","while 53 argures that its about love."
"arg5","7","Orientation","Homosexual couples don't fit into the accepted standard of marriage "
"arg5","7","Evaluation","therefore they should be excluded, "
"arg5","7","Action","the other writer says "
"arg5","7","Evaluation","that the cultural standard is oppressive, and of a majority that ignores the rights of the minority"
"arg5","8","Evaluation","writer 52 is dumb "
"arg5","8","Evaluation","because he descibes mariage as a culture thing but then defines it by his own words "
"arg5","8","Evaluation","and writer 53 just wants to know who makes up these "cultural appropriateness"."
"arg5","9","Evaluation","writer 53 talks about how marriage is up for individual people to decide, "
"arg5","9","Evaluation","while writer 52 talks about how the legal and cultural definitions and how homosexuality does not fit these definitions. "
